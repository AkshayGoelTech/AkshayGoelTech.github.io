<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this expanding world of Computer Science, programmers need enthusiasm and cursiosity along with their skills. These days, there are so many programmers and developers that it is difficult for a student like me to get noticed by recruiters. There needed to be a way for me to stand out. 
<br>
This website is a result of that desire. I created this website portfolio as a way to 'advertise' myself and also show my skillset at the same time. Not having used any pre-made website services like wix or wordpress, I am also demostrating my curiosity, eagerness and intent to 'create'.
